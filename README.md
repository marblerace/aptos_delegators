# Delegators Count

Total Delegators: 47042
Total APT Delegated: 306604922

OP received for the third airdrop on 18.09.2023 (price of OP was $1.368):
Addresses received drop: 31870
Average amount received: 609.08 ($833.22)
Median amount received: 238.49 ($326.26)
Total drop distribution: 19411313 ($26554676.18)


If Aptos Foundation spent the same amount for the delegation airdrop as Optimism Foundation team ($26554676.18),
they will spend 2792289.82 APT for this airdrop.
With this logic, every APT delegate will receive on average: 59.36 APT ($564.49)
